# Love2D-Abstraction
Simple project that can load the equivalent of a simple main file and play through different files.
For example, if you have a simple little game that runs in a single file and you want to add a menu to the game, you would put in your game and the code for the menu and program the menu to make the application switch, from running the menu file to the game file.
